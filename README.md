# Flag Icon Rounded Square
A flag icon replacement with a small rounded square that is 18x18 pixels. There are no patterns. 

### Summary
 This script simply contains a flag icon replacement. It can be described a small rounded square that is 18x18 pixels. There are no patterns. It is just a solid fill color.

 Why use this icon? There are two primary reasons:

1. When there are a lot friendly players in the same area, it can be incredibly difficult to quickly determine who your flag carrier actually is. This is truly a pain when in LT - especially LT with higher numbers. The reason is that all the icons are colored green. The flag icon is green, the friendly IFF is green, and, if you are using buddy points, then your waypoints are green. It's just a green mess with not enough differentiation. 

2. T2 is incredibly limited with how you can color friendly and enemy icons. The game forces you to use .png files, and it programmatically changes that .png files so that it either is green in color (friendly) or red in color (enemy). There is nothing you can do to prevent this. 
 
Within these constraints, the only thing you can control is the darkness of the green. A transparent .png will color as neon green. If you start with a darker color (ex: red, purple), then you'll end up as a darker green. There is *one* exception. If you color your .png solid black, then the game is unable to change the color - it will actually display black.

Given the above, I tried to find a flag icon that was very visible. I found that a black color did not pop out enough against the terrain - it was too easy to miss / blend in. So, I played with a number of patterns, sizes, and green color variations to find an icon that stood out.

Using a small, solid circle / rectangle seemed to work the best. It stands out very clearly from far away, and it pops out enough during hectic LT standoffs.
